AIM: To study and implement Operators in C++

SOFTWARE USED: VS Code

THEORY: Operators in C++ are special symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. Understanding operators is essential for writing logic, calculations, and decision-making code. --Types of Operators

Arithmetic Operators Used for basic mathematical operations:
+, -, *, /, % (modulo)
Relational Operators Used to compare values and return Boolean results:
==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
Logical Operators Used to combine or modify Boolean conditions:
&& (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT)
Assignment Operators Assign values to variables:
=, +=, -=, *=, /=
Increment/Decrement Operators Used to increase or decrease variable values:
++, -- (both in prefix and postfix forms)
Bitwise Operators Used for binary-level operations:
&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
Conditional (Ternary) Operator Shorthand for an if-else condition:
condition ? expr1 : expr2;
CONCLUSION: Operators form the backbone of C++ programming logic. By understanding how each type works, you can manipulate data, control flow, and evaluate conditions effectively. From basic arithmetic to complex bit manipulation, mastering operators empowers you to write cleaner, more efficient, and powerful code.
