Aim

To learn how decision-making works in C++ using if, else if, and else.

To check conditions using relational and logical operators.
Objectives

Use if, else if, and else to write programs for:

Checking if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

Giving grades to a student based on average marks.

Finding the quadrant of a point (x, y) in coordinate system.

Understand the use of relational operators like >, <, >=, <=.

Use logical operators like &&, ||, ==.
Program Description
Syntax and Flow

First, we declare variables to store user inputs like marks, x, y, etc.

The condition is checked inside parentheses ( ) after if.

The code block that should run when the condition is true is written inside curly braces { }.

If one condition is false, it checks the next using else if. If none match, the else part runs.
Using If-Else

C++ checks whether a condition is true (1) or false (0).

If it is true, the if block runs.

If false, the next option (else if or else) runs.
Concepts Used

If-Else statements

Relational Operators: >, <, >=, <=

Logical Operators: && (AND), || (OR), == (equal to)
Sample Output
Finding whether the number is positive or negative

Value of a: 17
Value of b: -8
A is a +ve number.
B is a -ve number.
